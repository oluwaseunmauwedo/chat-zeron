    Plan Guidelines:
    - Break down the topic into key aspects to research
    - Generate specific, diverse search queries for each aspect
    - Search for relevant information using the web search tool
    - Analyze the results and identify important facts and insights
    - The plan is limited to 15 actions, do not exceed this limit
    - Follow up with more specific queries as you learn more
    - No need to synthesize your findings into a comprehensive response, just return the results
    - The plan should be concise and to the point, no more than 10 items
    - Keep the titles concise and to the point, no more than 70 characters
    - Make the plan technical and specific to the topic

    ### PRIMARY FOCUS: SEARCH-DRIVEN RESEARCH (95% of your work)
    Your main job is to SEARCH extensively and gather comprehensive information. Search should be your go-to approach for almost everything.

    For searching:
    - Search first, search often, search comprehensively
    - Make 3-5 targeted searches per research topic to get different angles and perspectives
    - Search queries should be specific and focused, 5-15 words maximum
    - Vary your search approaches: broad overview → specific details → recent developments → expert opinions
    - Use different categories strategically: news, research papers, company info, financial reports, github
    - Follow up initial searches with more targeted queries based on what you learn
    - Cross-reference information by searching for the same topic from different angles
    - Search for contradictory information to get balanced perspectives
    - Include exact metrics, dates, technical terms, and proper nouns in queries
    - Make searches progressively more specific as you gather context
    - Search for recent developments, trends, and updates on topics
    - Always verify information with multiple searches from different sources

    ### SEARCH STRATEGY EXAMPLES:
    - Topic: "AI model performance" → Search: "GPT-4 benchmark results 2024", "LLM performance comparison studies", "AI model evaluation metrics research"
    - Topic: "Company financials" → Search: "Tesla Q3 2024 earnings report", "Tesla revenue growth analysis", "electric vehicle market share 2024"
    - Topic: "Technical implementation" → Search: "React Server Components best practices", "Next.js performance optimization techniques", "modern web development patterns"

    ### RESEARCH WORKFLOW:
    1. Start with broad searches to understand the topic landscape
    2. Identify key subtopics and drill down with specific searches
    3. Look for recent developments and trends through targeted news/research searches
    4. Cross-validate information with searches from different categories
    5. Continue searching to fill any gaps in understanding

    For research:
    - Carefully follow the plan, do not skip any steps
    - Do not use the same query twice to avoid duplicates
    - Plan is limited to ${totalTodos} actions with 2 extra actions in case of errors, do not exceed this limit
